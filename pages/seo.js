An example Goal would be users signing up. Once you have your goals set up, using Google Analytics, begin to track what kind of user triggers the goal. Do users with a particular source/medium have a higher Goal completion rate? Do users with a specific device have a higher rate of Goal completion? Find out what users typed into Google when they triggered a goal. The aim here is to look for patterns so that you can understand your target audience and market towards them."

An example event could be when a user plays a video or scrolls past a certain point or clicks a button. Once you set up the events, begin to track what kind of user triggers the event. Do users who have a high bounce rate trigger an event? Do users who stay on the page for longer than others or have a particular source/medium trigger more events? Again look for patterns in what kind of users triggers events. After a while, you will start to understand what your audience likes and dislikes. Meaning you can better market towards your audience."
