                <p className="section--body--text">Daniel Bisgrove started at humble beginnings as an Apprentice Developer and eventually became the Head Developer of a large company and teaches weekly at a coding school called Global U.</p>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>Daniel started coding in 2010 at age 16 when he got his first job working at an e-learning platform as a Helpdesk Administrator. The job mostly involved solving issues users were having, but when there were no issues, He would learn to code and help the development team on projects.</p>
                <p>In 2012 Daniel got accepted for an apprentice position at a digital agency called Star Digital, where he helped build websites and assist other developers. For the next 3 years, he worked for Star Digital and their sibling company Auction Marketer.</p>
                <p>After the first year, Daniel was promoted to Junior Web Developer and soon after to Front-end developer. By this time, Daniel was leading a team of developers on a variety of projects such as e-commerce stores and custom web applications, while teaching new apprentices and junior developers how to code. In the last year working at Star Digital and Auction Marketer, Daniel became a Full-Stack Developer, meaning he was a Front-End and Back-End Developer. He was offered the job as Lead Developer of Auction Marketer, which he turned down and left the company to pursue leadership skills and his faith.</p>
                <p>Soon after Daniel met his lovely wife, Mary Bisgrove, who is an American, and they ended up moving to the United States. It wasnâ€™t long before Daniel started a new job as a Full-Stack developer at Adventures in Missions and World Race Mission Trips, managing their websites and building advanced web applications.</p>
                <p>In 2020 Daniel was promoted to Lead Developer where he leads a team of developers and teaches web development, UI, UX and marketing skills at Global U, a nine-month full-stack web development program for young adults.</p>
